#Froyo: Node.js Micro Awesomeness
Froyo(frozen-yogurt) is a simple, expressive node.js micro-framework.

##Install

###With npm:

```
npm install froyo
```

###Build from source:

Needs Jake

```
git clone git://github.com/PyScripter255/frozen-yogurt.git

cd frozen-yogurt

jake build
```

##Example

```javascript
var froyo = require("froyo")

var thePosts = {
    "bob": ["Froyo is cool", "Have you tried it?"],
    "joe": ["Really?", "Nope"]
}

function givePosts(req, res){
    res.writeHead(200, {"Content-Type": "text/json"})
    res.end(JSON.stringify(thePosts))
}

function index(req, res){
    res.render("./index.html", "mustache", {lasestPost: "foobar"})
}

var postComment = {
    post: function(req, res){
        res.writeHead(200, {"Content-Type": "text/json"})
        var comment = "";
        req.on("data", function(data){
            var comment += data;
        })
        req.on("end", function(){
            posts[req.params.post].addComment(JSON.parse(comment))
        })
        }
}

froyo.scoop({
    "/": index,
    "/posts": givePosts,
    "/comment/:post": postComment
}, 8080)
```

##API Docs:

###Froyo

Main namespace. Contains all of connect.middleware

###Froyo.app [Function]

returns a new app

###App [Object]

It's an extended version of the connect server. It has the following extra methods:

####App.scoop

Adds request handlers to your app. It can be called at anytime, and the routes are based on [routes](https://github.com/aaronblohowiak/routes.js).

Takes an Object mapping paramter

#####Example

```javascript
app.scoop({
    '/': index,
    '/posts/:post': getPost
})
```

####App.start

Takes a port argument. Starts the app at the port specified.

#####Example

```javascript
app.start(8080)
```

Basically like doing this:

```javascript
http.createServer(app).listen(8080)
```

###Froyo request handlers

Just like node.js request handlers:

```javascript
function(req, res){

}
```
However there are some differences.

1. ```req.params.*``` is populated with the field you specified in the url routes.

```javascript
app.scoop({
    '/posts/:post': posts // req.params.post is populated
})
```

2. You can also pass objects

```javascript
var index = {
    get: function(req, res){
    ...
    },
    post: function(req, res){
    ...
    }
}
//etc.
app.scoop({
    '/': index
})
```

If you pass a function, that function is served for GET requests.

```javascript
function index(req, res){
...
}

//and

var index = {
    get: function(req, res){
    ...
    }
}

//are the same thing

//but!
function index(req, res){
...
}

//and

var index = {
    get: function(req, res){
    ...
    },
    post: function(req, res){
    //exact same function
    }
}
//are not the same!
```

##Developer Guide

###Style Guide

1. If a function returns nothing, it should return a boolean (based on whether the function worked or not) For testing
2. Use streams if possible (for both internals and user experience).
3. The API should be dead simple
4. The API should be expressive and unopinionated
5. The comments should be short but descriptive. Please don't overload comments

###Dependencies
####These are only if you want to work with the code, not use it as a module
1. npm
2.jake (```npm install jake```)

###Work with the code

1. Install (the rest of the) dev dependencies ```jake deps```
2. Install with ```jake install```
3. Test with ```npm test``` or ```mocha```
