It's small enough that people probably could memorize and retype the file. It is public domain, no restrictions. Nodejs is licensed with the MIT license\n\nUsage:\n\nSo, to use froyo.js, you need to\n\n1. require the module: var froyo = require(\"./path/to/froyo\")\n\n2. Define your request handlers as functions. The functions must have only 2 arguments request and response:\n\nfunction main(req, res){\nres.writeHead(200, {\"Content-Type\": \"text/html\"})\nres.write(\"Hello World!\")\nres.end()\n}\n\n3. Define your url mapping as a JSON variable\n\nvar map = {\n\"/\": main,\n'/whatever': whateverFunction\n}\n\n4. Pass the map variable to the function froyo.scoop():\n\nfroyo.scoop(map, optionalPortVariable)\n\n5. Enjoy!\n"]],"start1":0,"start2":0,"length1":0,"length2":781}]],"length":781}
