Define your request handlers as functions. The functions must have only 2 arguments request and response:\n```\nfunction main(req, res){\nres.writeHead(200, {\"Content-Type\": \"text/html\"})\nres.write(\"Hello World!\")\nres.end()\n}\n```\n3. Define your url mapping as a JSON variable\n```\nvar map = {\n\"/\": main,\n'/whatever': whateverFunction\n}\n```\n4. Pass the map variable to the function froyo.scoop():\n```\nfroyo.scoop(map, optionalPortVariable)\n```\n5. Enjoy!\n"]],"start1":0,"start2":0,"length1":0,"length2":883}]],"length":883}
